# next-mail (v0.0.1)

Next-Mail specification version 0.0.1.

## Payload format

Every email will be sent in JSON format and UTF-16 encoding (without JSON comments).
All properties must follow the kebab-case naming convention.

Some attributes are optional, in such case they can be omitted or provided with a null value.
When an optional attribute is omitted then it should be assumed to be null.
When a mandatory attribute is missing or null then the email should be considered invalid.

### Sending and receiving emails

Each email can have one or more destinataries, and each one could belong to a different domain. So, every time an email is sent
two arguments must be sent to each one of this different domains:

1. An exact copy of the email.
2. A salted hash string that uniquely identifies the email being sent.

The hash string will become a globally unique identifier for the email across all organizations. This string will be used for two purposes:

1. To verify if the email (json) received is complete.
2. To uniquely identify the email when replies are sent across multiple domains.

So, when a domain receives an email the hash string must be stored as the `message-id`. 

|Attribute                |Description                                                   |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
|message-id               |A string that identifies the email received across the world. |

When an email is sent only one message is sent to each different domain instead of one message per recipient.
The list of different domains can be obtained by looking at the recipients (from, to, cc, bcc) in the email.

For example, when an email is sent as follows:

{
    "from": "steve@foo.com",
    "to": ["lisa@bar.com", "javier@baz.org"],
    "cc": ["sales-team@foo.com"],
    "bcc": ["steve@zmail.com"],
    ...
}

In this case there are four different domains involved: foo.com, bar.com, baz.org and zmail.com.
However foo.com will save the email in the local database. This means that only 3 copies of this email will be sent over the net. 
After each domain receives its respective copy then each one of those servers will internally route a copy to each individual recipient.

Following the previous example, foo.com will internally send a copy to steve@foo.com (sent folder) and one to each member of the sale-team group.
Other domains should do the same: save the email in the database and rout it to each individual recipient that belongs to that domain in particular.

```
[email]
   |
   +---> foo.com --> DB --+---> notify: steve@foo.com 
   |                      |
   |                      +--> sales-team@foo.com ---> notify: susan@foo.com, mark@foo.com, lauren@foo.com, ...
   |
   +---> bar.com --> DB --> notify: lisa@bar.com
   |
   +---> baz.org --> DB --> notify: javier@baz.org
   |
   +---> zmail.com --> DB --> notify: steve@zmail.com
```

### Replies payload format

Unlike traditional emails replies do not include the original message (or conversation), instead, they just reference the original email:

```
{
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "type": "reply",
  "from": "sandra-doe@example.com",
  "sender-fingerprint": "$2y$12$sgofxSYqPzFN78yFneHU6OMY3ydUMtXjG6fvSRkfCNJNudlkzOWQq",
  
  "original-message-id": "2e87284d245c2aae1c74fa4c50a74c77c17b6e9b160cda0cf583e89ec7b7fc22",
  "sent-time": "2020-12-22T00:04:23Z",

  "body":"Thanks John, I'll check it.",
  
  "signature": {
    "full-name": "Sandra Doe",
    "company-name": "Example Dot Com SA",
    "address-line-1": "77 Massachusetts Ave",
    "address-line-2": null,
    "city": "Cambridge",
    "state": "MA",
    "zip-code": "02139",
    "company-url": "www.example.com",
    "phone-numbers": [
        {"number": "202-555-5556", "type": "OFFICE", "country-code": 1}
    ]
  }
  "attachments": []
}
```


Mandatory attributes are:

|Attribute    |Description                                          |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
|version      |The version number of the email JSON object.         |
|type         |In this case it should always be 'reply'.            |
|original-message-id|The message-id of the original email received. |
|reply-id     |A unique string that identifies the reply. The reply-id should be unique domain-wide.|
|from         |The email address of the sender.|
|sender-fingerprint|A hash string generated by the sender using the sender's secret code.|
|to           |An array of strings each one containing an email address. Cannot be empty.|
|sent-time    |A string representing a timestamp in ISO 8601 in UTC timezone (UTC always).|
|subject      |A string up to 100 characters long. Plain text only.|
|body         |A string up to 4MB in size (including text and inline images).|


Optional attributes are:

|Attribute    |Description                                          |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
|cc           |An array of strings each one containing an email address.|
|bcc          |An array of strings each one containing an email address.|
|signature    |The sender's contact card. All attributes are optional as well except for `full-name` which is mandatory if the `signature` attribute is defined.|
|attachments  |An array of elements each one representing a file (see the Attachments section).|
|appointment  |An email can include 0 or 1 appointment (see the Appointments section)|
|task         |An email can include 0 or 1 task (see the Tasks section)|
|tags         |An email can include string tags (see the Tags section)|

## How replies work

When a user replies to an email, potentially involving destinataries at multiple domains, then an exact copy of the reply
will be sent to each domain (including the domain of the user sending the reply).

For this reason the reply should contain the salted hash code that identifies the original email.

When a reply is sent only one message is sent to each different domain instead of one message per destinatary.
The list of different domains can be obtained by looking at the recipients (from, to, cc, bcc) in the original email.

For example, if the original email was sent to these persons:

```
{
    "from": "steve@foo.com",
    "to": ["lisa@bar.com", "javier@baz.org"],
    "cc": ["sales-team@foo.com"],
    "bcc": ["steve@zmail.com"],
    ...
}
```

When any of the recipients replies to the email (i.e. lisa@bar.com) then bar.com saves the reply in the local database
and sends a copy of the reply to the other 3 domains: foo.com, baz.org and zmail.com.

After each domain receives a copy and saves it, then all recipients should be sent a push notification containing the reply.
In order to know who the original recipients were, the original message should be found in the database using the `original-message-id`.
Each domain should only care about notifying the users that belong to the current organization.

```
[reply to original-message-id=2e87284d245... from lisa@bar.com]
    | 
    +---> foo.com --> DB -+--> notify: steve@foo.com 
    |                     |
    |                     +--> sales-team@foo.com ---> notify: susan@foo.com, mark@foo.com, lauren@foo.com, ...
    |
    +---> baz.org --> DB ---> notify: javier@baz.org
    |
    +---> zmail.com --> DB ---> notify: steve@zmail.com
```

In the example above the reply doesn't need to be sent to bar.com since it already has been saved and notified locally.


## Sender identification

### Verification request

An HTTP request is sent to the original domain including the original sender's address and the `sender-fingerprint` and the emails' hash value as follows:

```
{
  "from": "john-doe@example.com",
  "sender-fingerprint": "$2y$12$sgofxSYqPzFN78yFneHU6OMY3ydUMtXjG6fvSRkfCNJNudlkzOWQq",
  "message-id": "2e87284d245c2aae1c74fa4c50a74c77c17b6e9b160cda0cf583e89ec7b7fc22"
}
```

Following the example above, the request will be sent to `nmail.example.com/verify` which will do the following:

1. An account exists for the sender.
2. The hash code is valid against the sender's secret code, which is a randomized unique string generated for that user when the account was created.
3. The account did send a message that matches the given `message-id`, and the generated `sender-fingerprint` hash code in that event matches as well.

Next-mail servers should allow user's to renew their secret code, if and only if, any previous valid secret code are kept. If previous valid secret codes
are deleted then any previous emails sent from that email account will be rendered as "unverified sender" by mail clients.

Next-mail clients should keep indexes for values: `from`, `sender-fingerprint` and `message-id`. Mail clients should actively refuse any emails received with a duplicate `sender-fingerprint` or `message-id` values since those values are meant to be unique at all times. Re-sending or forwarding emails should provide new values for those two fields at the moment the message is sent.

### Verification endpoint

The next-mail verification URL will be constructed from the domain in the sender's mail address. The company should publish a subdomain called `nmail` which in turn should provide an endpoint called `verify`.

Custom verification URLs should not be allowed since that could bypass this verification mechanism really easily. For example, an attacker could impersonate a CEO of a company by using his/her email address in the `from` field and then providing a verification URL to a server like `2y6yy9Hglsjza2EBqAADgNq24naGAZo4EepM0Nli.biz/verify` that simply replies successfully to all requests it receives.

### Verification response

The verification response should include all the fields received in the request plus two more fields called `verified` and `verification-date`. Example:

```
{
  "from": "john-doe@example.com",
  "sender-fingerprint": "$2y$12$sgofxSYqPzFN78yFneHU6OMY3ydUMtXjG6fvSRkfCNJNudlkzOWQq",
  "message-id": "2e87284d245c2aae1c74fa4c50a74c77c17b6e9b160cda0cf583e89ec7b7fc22",
  "verified": true,
  "verification-date": "2020-12-22T00:04:22Z"
}
```


## Dates format

ISO 8601 - Limited to UTC only, clients should convert the dates to the local date and time according to the user's timezone.

```
"sent-time": "2020-12-22T00:04:12Z"
```


## Rich text markup

For security reasons we should prevent the inclusion of HTML and Javascript code in messages. For these reasons a custom markup language will be used to format text in emails.

### Headers

```
[H1]Lorem ipsum[/H1]
[H2]Lorem ipsum[/H2]
[H3]Lorem ipsum[/H3]
[H4]Lorem ipsum[/H4]
[H5]Lorem ipsum[/H5]
[H6]Lorem ipsum[/H6]
```

### Basic text formatting

```
[b]Bold text[/b]
[i]Italics[/i]
[u]Underline[/u]
[s]Striked text[/s]
[super]super index[/super]
[sub]subindex[/sub]
[left]left aligned[/left]
[center]centered text[/center]
[right]right aligned[/right]
[justify]justified text[/justify]
[div]...[/div]
[span]...[/span]
[code]...[/code]
[cite]...[/cite]
[blockquote]...[/blockquote]
[p]...[/p]
[pre]...[/pre]
[ul]
    [li]Milk[/li]
    [li]Coffee[/li]
[/ul]
```

The list is not meant to be extensive; it is only meant to support a subset of HTML tags sufficient for creating good-looking emails.
Tags like `iframe`,`script`,`form`,`input`,`select`,`embed`and `canvas`, among others, won't and shouldn't be allowed in the future. This means no tracking/analytics scripts in the emails you receive.

### Images

External images:
For security reasons external images are not supported.
(TODO: consider allowing external images, then fetching the image files in the back end and translating them into Base64 strings before being sent to the front end)

Inline images:
```
[img]image/png;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[/img]
```

### Hyperlinks

```
[mailto:{Hyperlink text}]{Email Address}[/mailto]
[url:{Hyperlink text}]{URL}[/url]
```

Examples:
```
[mailto:John Doe, Finance]john-doe@example.com[/mailto]
[url:Security Awareness Meeting]http://www.example.com/events/2021/March/security-awareness-meeting[/url]
```

Next-mail servers and clients should implement a mechanism that verifies URLs and renders them unclickable to all users when blacklisted. Before visiting the link the next-mail client will create a shortened version of it, the short URL will be opened instead of the original one.

Hyperlinks executing `javascript` code will simply not be allowed.

### Tables

```
[table;class:balance-sheet]
  [row;class:banner-row]
    [col;span:3]
      [img]image/png; ... [/img]
    [/col]
  [/row]
  [row;class:header-row]
    [col]Number[col]
    [col]Description[col]
    [col]Amount ($USD)[col]
  [/row]
  [row]
    [col]1[/col]
    [col]Net income[/col]
    [col]$14.564M[/col]
  [row]
  ...
[/table]
```

### CSS Formatting

As you could see in the `tables` section you can use class names. The CSS code for a next-mail 
email is defined in the `css` attribute at the root node.

```
{
  ...
  "body": "[div;class=mail-title]Some text[/div]",
  "css": ".mail-title {
    text-align: center;
    font-size: 14px;
    font-weight: bold;
    color: #EE0022;
  }"
  ...
}
```

You can also define classes in other tags seen before. Use a semicolon (;) to separate the class definition from the rest of the tag as follows:

```
[div;class:main-section]...[/div]
[code;class:code-block-java]...[/code]
[mailto:John Doe, Finance;class:mailto-link]john-doe@example.com[/mailto]
[ul;class:numbered-list]...[/ul]
[12;class:simple-text]...[/12]
```

Also you can add styles to all tags of the same type just like in HTML:

```
{
    ...
    "body": "
        [div]This is a div[/div]
        [div]This is another div[/div]
        [span]This is a span[/span]
    ",
    "css": "
      div {
        display: block;
        font-size: 14pt;
        color: black;
      }
      span {
        display: inline-block;
        font-size: 12pt;
        background-color: black;
        color: white;
      }
    "
}
```

The signature card can also be formatted using class name `.contact-card`. 
Each element in the card will be a `div` with a CSS class named as the attribute it represents, for example:

```css
.contact-card {
    width: 450px;
    font-size: 12px;
}
.contact-card.full-name {
    // css
}
.contact-card.company-name {
    // css
}
.contact-card.address-line-1 {
    // css
}
.contact-card.address-line-2 {
    // css
}
.contact-card.phone-numbers:first-child {
    // css for the first phone number displayed
}
.contact-card.phone-numbers:nth-child(2) {
    // css for the second phone number displayed
}
```

A custom CSS signature formatting can be defined company-wide and will be applied by default to all users in it.

Tags like `url` and `mailto` will become HTML anchors (`<a href="..."/>`).

### Escape codes

Next-mail escape sequences:

|Sequence |Description                      |
|---------|---------------------------------|
|\\[      |to escape left square brackets   |
|\\]      |to escape right square brackets  |
|\\"      |to escape double quotes          |
|\\\\     |to escape backslash              |


## Attachments

Emails and replies can contain file attachments (optional). The attachments' data value is also a Base64 encoded string.

```
  ...
  "attachments": [
    {
      "file-name": "Monthly report January 2021.pdf",

## Tasks

Sometimes you may send an email asking someone to perform a task and want to know the progress.
The current state of the task will be visible to all persons who received that email. The state should be handled and updated by next-mail clients.

Only one task per email allowed (optional).

```
{
  ...
  "task": {
    "individual": false,
    "workflow": [
      "TODO",
      "IN-PROGRESS",
      "DONE"
    ],
    "end-states": ["3"],
    "checklist": [
      "Create the sales report",
      "Peer review it",
      "Send report to Sandra"
    ],
    "deadline": "2021-02-01T12:15:00Z",
    "timezone": -5
  }
}
```

A description may not be necessary in the task itself, it must be written in the email's body.
Checklist and deadline are optional but `worflow` and `end-states` are mandatory. There could be cases in which more that one state could be considered as a final state. Workflows may be created in the next-mail client and they are copied to the email instead of being written every time per email.

Tasks only apply to recipients in the `to` field and only within the same domain as the sender. 
Tasks can be individual (one state per recipient) or not (one state for everyone).

## Tags

Emails may optionally include tags to help sort them or trigger actions setup using third party plugins.

```
{
  ...
  "tags": [
    "sales-department", "reminders", "work"
  ]
}
```

```
{
  ...
  "tags": [
    "echo", "lights", "turn-on", "living room"
  ]
}
```
